                        When was the last time you thought about who has access to your home? Most homeowners don't consider their lock security until something goes wrong. But by then, it may be too late. Rekeying your locks is one of the most affordable and effective ways to ensure your home's security, and there are several clear signs that indicate when it's time to take action.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="font-display text-3xl text-white mt-12 mb-6">1. You've Just Moved Into a New Home</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        This is the number one reason people need to rekey their locks, yet many homeowners skip this crucial step. When you buy or rent a new property, you have no idea how many copies of the keys exist. Previous owners, real estate agents, contractors, cleaners, and neighbors may all have copies.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        <strong class="text-white">Our recommendation:</strong> Rekey all exterior locks within the first week of moving in. This is far more affordable than replacing all your locks and provides the same level of security.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="font-display text-3xl text-white mt-12 mb-6">2. You've Lost Your Keys or Had Them Stolen</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Lost keys are more than an inconvenience. They're a security risk. If your keys fell out of your pocket in a public place, anyone could have picked them up. Worse, if your keys were stolen along with your wallet or purse, the thief may have your address too.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Don't wait to see if something happens. A proactive rekey is much cheaper than dealing with a break-in. If you suspect your keys were stolen rather than lost, consider rekeying immediately and filing a police report.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="font-display text-3xl text-white mt-12 mb-6">3. You've Had a Roommate or Tenant Move Out</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        When someone moves out of your property, they're supposed to return all their keys. But did they make copies? Did they give a spare to a friend or partner? You can never be 100% certain, which is why landlords and homeowners with roommates should rekey after every move-out.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        This is especially important if the separation wasn't amicable. Protect yourself and your property by rekeying your locks and eliminating any potential security vulnerabilities.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="font-display text-3xl text-white mt-12 mb-6">4. Your Locks Are Old or Showing Signs of Wear</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Locks don't last forever. If you're having trouble turning your key, if the lock feels loose, or if you notice visible rust or damage, it's time for attention. While rekeying addresses who has access, sometimes older locks need to be replaced entirely for mechanical reasons.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Signs your lock may need replacement rather than rekeying:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="text-gray-300 space-y-2 mb-6">
                        <li class="flex items-start"><span class="w-2 h-2 bg-primary rounded-full mr-3 mt-2 flex-shrink-0"></span>Key frequently gets stuck or is difficult to turn</li>
                        <li class="flex items-start"><span class="w-2 h-2 bg-primary rounded-full mr-3 mt-2 flex-shrink-0"></span>Visible rust, corrosion, or physical damage</li>
                        <li class="flex items-start"><span class="w-2 h-2 bg-primary rounded-full mr-3 mt-2 flex-shrink-0"></span>Lock doesn't latch or lock properly</li>
                        <li class="flex items-start"><span class="w-2 h-2 bg-primary rounded-full mr-3 mt-2 flex-shrink-0"></span>Outdated lock technology (no deadbolt, cheap construction)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2 class="font-display text-3xl text-white mt-12 mb-6">5. You've Experienced a Break-In Attempt</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        If someone has attempted to break into your home, whether successful or not, you should have your locks inspected immediately. Even failed attempts can damage the lock mechanism in ways that aren't visible, making it easier to breach in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        After a break-in attempt, we recommend:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="text-gray-300 space-y-2 mb-6">
                        <li class="flex items-start"><span class="w-2 h-2 bg-primary rounded-full mr-3 mt-2 flex-shrink-0"></span>Having a professional locksmith inspect all locks for damage</li>
                        <li class="flex items-start"><span class="w-2 h-2 bg-primary rounded-full mr-3 mt-2 flex-shrink-0"></span>Upgrading to high-security locks if you haven't already</li>
                        <li class="flex items-start"><span class="w-2 h-2 bg-primary rounded-full mr-3 mt-2 flex-shrink-0"></span>Adding additional security measures like a deadbolt or smart lock</li>

                    <h2 class="font-display text-3xl text-white mt-12 mb-6">Rekeying vs. Replacing: What's the Difference?</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Many homeowners confuse rekeying with lock replacement. Here's the key difference:
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        <strong class="text-white">Rekeying</strong> changes the internal pins of your existing lock so that old keys no longer work. This is typically faster and more affordable, ranging from $15-$30 per lock. Your existing hardware stays in place.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        <strong class="text-white">Lock Replacement</strong> involves removing the entire lock and installing a new one. This is necessary when locks are damaged, outdated, or when you want to upgrade to better hardware. Costs vary based on the quality of the new lock.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="font-display text-3xl text-white mt-12 mb-6">How Long Does Rekeying Take?</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        A professional locksmith can typically rekey a standard lock in 10-15 minutes. If you need multiple locks rekeyed, most locksmiths can do your entire home in under an hour. The process is minimally invasive and you can use your new keys immediately.
